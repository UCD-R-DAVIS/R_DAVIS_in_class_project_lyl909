# ggplot2 ----
## Grammar of Graphics plotting package (included in tidyverse package - you can see this when you call library(tidyverse)!)
## easy to use functions to produce pretty plots
## ?ggplot2 will take you to the package helpfile where there is a link to the website: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org - this is where you'll find the cheatsheet with visuals of what the package can do!

## ggplot basics
## every plot can be made from these three components: data, the coordinate system (ie what gets mapped), and the geoms (how to graphical represent the data)
## Syntax: ggplot(data = <DATA>) + <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPING>))

## tips and tricks
## think about the type of data and how many data  variables you are working with -- is it continuous, categorical, a combo of both? is it just one variable or three? this will help you settle on what type of geom you want to plot
## order matters! ggplot works by layering each geom on top of the other
## also aesthetics like color & size of text matters! make your plots accessible 


## example ----
library(tidyverse)
## load in data
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv") %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) # remove all NA's

## Let's look at two continuous variables: weight & hindfoot length
## Specific geom settings
ggplot(data= surveys, mapping =aes(x=weight,y=hindfoot_length, color = genus)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()#geom_count&con&point are common to use

## Universal geom settings








## Visualize weight categories and the range of hindfoot lengths in each group
## Bonus from hw: 
sum_weight <- summary(surveys$weight)
surveys_wt_cat <- surveys %>% 
  mutate(weight_cat = case_when(
    weight <= sum_weight[[2]] ~ "small", 
    weight > sum_weight[[2]] & weight < sum_weight[[5]] ~ "medium",
    weight >= sum_weight[[5]] ~ "large"
  )) 

table(surveys_wt_cat$weight_cat)


## We have one categorical variable and one continuous variable - what type of plot is best?
##ggplot(data = surveys_wt_cat,aes(x=weight_cat, y=hindfoot_length))+
 ## geom_boxplot(aes(color = weight_cat)) #point-stream, boxplot-each value of each cataglory

ggplot(data = surveys_wt_cat,aes(x=weight_cat, y=hindfoot_length))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(color=weight_cat),alpha=0.8)+
  geom_point(alpha=0.1)


## What if I want to switch order of weight_cat? factor!

surveys_wt_cat$weight_cat <- factor(surveys_wt_cat$weight_cat,c("small","medium","large"))

ggplot(data= surveys_wt_cat, aes(x= weight_cat,y= hindfoot_length)) 



library(tidyverse)

surveys_complete <- read_csv('data/portal_data_joined.csv') %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.))

# these are two different ways of doing the same thing
head(surveys_complete %>% count(year,species_id))
head(surveys_complete %>% group_by(year,species_id) %>% tally())

yearly_counts <- surveys_complete %>% count(year,species_id)

head(yearly_counts)

ggplot(data = yearly_counts,mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(data = yearly_counts,mapping = aes(x = year, y= n)) +
  geom_line()

ggplot(data = yearly_counts,mapping = aes(x = year, y= n,group = species_id)) +
  geom_line()


ggplot(data = yearly_counts,mapping = aes(x = year, y= n, colour = species_id)) +
  geom_line()


ggplot(data = yearly_counts, mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ species_id)


ggplot(data = yearly_counts, mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ species_id,scales = 'free')
